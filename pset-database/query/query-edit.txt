@comment(This file gets @include'd in query-language problem sets)
In order to make it easier to type complicated queries, we have added a
command to the query language that will let you use the editor.  If you
type @i[(edit)] to the @i[query-->] prompt, it will return you to the
editor.  You can use the editor to compose a query and @i[zap] one query
down at a time.  Use the @i[zap define] function to mark exactly one query
to be executed; then use the @i[scheme] function to get back to the query
language.  Do not use the @i[edit] key on the terminal; that is like typing
^G and then @i[(edit)], which will get you out of the query language (back
into Scheme) and then into the editor.
