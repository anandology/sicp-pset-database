@comment(This file gets @include'd in query-language problem sets)
You can use the @i[load-problem-set] command to load the
query language described in Chapter 4 of the text.  As you will
notice, the query language is not very efficient.  To avoid
slowing it down, be sure @i[not] to load the source code for the language
from the editor -- the version you get from @i[load-problem-set] has been
run through a simple optimizer that may speed the code up by as much as
25% (we haven't timed it).
