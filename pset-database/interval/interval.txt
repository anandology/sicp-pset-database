@b[LABORATORY ASSIGNMENT: Interval Arithmetic]
@end(center)

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice with
data abstraction.
The assignment is based on section 2.1.4 of the text. Most of the
problems are exercises from that section.

@begin(center)
@b[Pre-Laboratory Exercises]
@end(center)

Think about and answer the following questions before going to the laboratory.
@begin(itemize)
Exercise 2.8

Exercise 2.12
@end(itemize)

@begin(center)
@b[In the Laboratory]
@end(center)
In this laboratory you will be working with Alyssa's interval
arithmetic package.
Install the code for Problem Set ??? using the @a[load-problem-set]
operation. The file to be loaded contains all the
procedures described in section 2.1.4 of the text.

???Fix the following writeup re modifications file.

The procedures you will need to modify for exercises 2.9 and 2.10
are in a "modifications file" that will be installed on your disk.
You can add new procedures to this file too.


@paragraph(Representing intervals)
Do Exercise 2.6.

@paragraph(Subtracting intervals)
Do Exercise 2.7.

@paragraph(Improving Alyssa's programs)
Do Exercises 2.9 and 2.10.

@paragraph(Percentage tolerances)
Do Exercise 2.11.
   
@paragraph(``Equivalent'' programs?)
Do Exercise 2.13.
   
@begin(center)
@b[Post-Laboratory Exercises]
@end(center)

Work on the following exercises after you have left the laboratory.

@begin(itemize)
Exercise 2.14.

Optional: Exercise 2.15.  This problem is very difficult.
If you have any ideas about this, you are invited to try them
out, but do not neglect your required work in order to work on this.
