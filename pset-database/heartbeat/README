Future users of this problem set please note: It needs a lot of work!

We adapted this problem set from a version used in a previous semester, but
made only small changes.  We didn't realize until after it was distributed how
much more work will be necessary before this problem set is reasonable.

It's a neat problem set, with a really fun plot, but it's a lot hairier than it
appears at first glance.

Things which should be changed:

  Split many of the problems into smaller ones which guide the student through
  the solutions to the problems.  The MONITOR problem in particular could use a
  little trimming or breaking down into subparts.

  There are a lot of ambiguities in the wording of the problems.

In short:

  Try doing the problem set yourself BEFORE you give this problem set to
  students (of course, this is in general a good rule, but it applies
  particularly to this problem set).

We've made some improvements and bug fixes in the problem set solution file
after we printed it for the students, so you should work from the file rather
than a printed file copy of this semester's solutions.  (The improvements are
mostly listed in the file ps7-sol-addendum.text.)
