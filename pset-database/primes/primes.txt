@section(Laboratory Assignment: Testing for Primality)

This laboratory assignment deals with the orders of growth in the
number of steps required by some algorithms that test whether a given
number is a prime.  It is based upon Section 1.2.6 of the text.  You
should read that material before beginning work on this assignment.

@paragraph(To Do at the Laboratory)

All the procedures from section 1.2.6 are installed on the
Chipmunk shared resource manager, and can be loaded onto your floppy
disk.  To do this, follow the instructions given in the Chipmunk
manual in the section on ``Loading Problem Set Files,'' to load the
code for problem set 2.  (The code for this problem set is
sufficiently short that we have not separated out the procedures that
you are expected to modify, as explained in the Chipmunk manual.)

There are slight differences between the @a[timed-prime-test] and
@a[fermat-test] procedures we have given you and the ones in the book.
@a[timed-prime-test] uses @a[princ] instead of @a[print] to avoid
starting a new line until it gets to the next number being tested.
@a[fermat-test] uses @a[big-random] instead of @a[random] because we
will be testing some very big numbers for primality, and the
@a[random] procedure built in to Scheme cannot generate extremely
large random numbers.  @a[big-random] is defined as
@begin(example)
   (define (big-random n)
     (random (min n (expt 10 10))))
@end(example)
This procedure can be called with arbitrarily large numbers, but will
only generate numbers less than or equal to 10@+[10].

@b[Part 1:]
Do exercise 1.16 from the text.

@b[Part 2:]
Define the following procedure, which, when called with an odd
integer n, tests the primality of consecutive odd integers starting
with n.  (Obviously, there is no point checking if even integers are
prime.)  The procedure will keep running until you interrupt it by
typing ctrl-G.
@begin(example)
(define (search-for-primes n)
  (timed-prime-test n)
  (search-for-primes (+ n 2)))
@end(example)
Transfer your new procedure to Scheme and test it.  When you are
satisfied that it is working, use @a[search-for-primes] to find the 3
smallest primes that are larger than larger than 1,000; larger
than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000.

Prepare a chart as follows:
@begin(smallfigurebody)
   Range: 1000

   Primes:   <prime1>     <prime2>      <prime3>

   Time1:      _____        _____         _____

   Time2:      _____        _____         _____

   Time3:      _____        _____         _____
@end(smallfigurebody)
and make similar charts for the ranges 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000.
In the spaces marked <prime>, fill in the three smallest primes you
found.  (You will fill in 12 primes in all, 3 in the chart for each
range.)  Under each prime, in the spaces marked <Time1>, fill in the
time used by the prime testing procedure to determine that the number
was prime.  (The Scheme primitive procedure @a[runtime] used in
@a[timed-prime-test] returns the amount of time in hundredths of a
second that the system has been running.)@foot[Be careful here.
@a[Runtime] counts not only actual compute time, but also garbage
collection time.  Garbage collection is a process that Scheme goes
through as part of its memory management.  (We will discuss this near
the end of the term.)  When Scheme is garbage-collecting, the letter G
appears at the lower right-hand corner of the screen.  (Ordinarily,
the Greek letter pi is shown there.)  If a garbage collection happens
during one of the computations whose time you care about, the
@a[runtime] number will be too large.  If you see a garbage collection
happening during one of the computations for a number in your chart,
it's best to retime the computation for that number.]

@b[Part 3:]
Modify @a[smallest-divisor] as described in exercise 1.18 in the text.
With @a[timed-prime-test] using this modified version of
@a[smallest-divisor], run the test for each of the 12 primes listed in
your table.  Enter the times required by the tests in your chart in
the slots marked <Time2>.

@b[Part 4:]
Back in the editor, modify @a[timed-prime-test] to use @a[fast-prime?] in
place of @a[prime?].  You can assume that a number is prime if it passes
the Fermat test two times.  Now test each of
your 12 primes as in Part 3 above and enter the required times in the
spaces marked <Time3>.

@b[Part 5:]
Now let's test some really big numbers for primality.
In 1644, the French mathematician Marin Mersenne published the claim
that numbers of the form 2@+[p]@t[-]1 are prime for the following
values of p and for no other p less than 257.
@begin(example)
               2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257
@end(example)
It turns out that Mersenne missed a few values of p, and that some of
the values in his list do not give primes.  Use @a[timed-prime-test]
(modified as in Part 4 to use @a[fast-prime?]) to determine which of
the values in Mersenne's list give primes, and which do not.  (Prime
numbers of the form 2@+[p]@t[-]1 are known as @i[Mersenne primes].)
Record the time required for each test.  To aid in testing, it will
help to define the following procedure:
@begin(example)
(define (mersenne p) (- (expt 2 p) 1))
@end(example)

@b[Part 6:] Let's try to find which values of p Mersenne missed.  A
straightforward way to do this is to write an iterative procedure that
checks, for all integers p in a given range, whether @a[(mersenne p)]
is prime.  If we blindly test all integers in a given range, however,
then we will be doing a lot of needless checking, because 2@+[p]@t[-]1
cannot be prime unless p is prime.  (Sketch of proof: Show that
2@+[ab]@t[-]1 is divisible by 2@+[a]@t[-]1.)  Write a procedure
@a[mersenne-range] that works as follows: For each p in a given range
of integers, the program should first use @a[prime?]  to test whether
p is prime.@foot[If you like, you can use @a[fast-prime?]  here.  But
the numbers @a[p] will be rather small so there is not much advantage.
Also, @a[fast-prime?] with only a couple of iterations is unreliable
for very small numbers.  Also be careful with @a[p]=2, for which
@a[fast-prime?] does not work.]  If so, it should use @a[fast-prime?]
to test whether @a[(mersenne p)] is prime.  As the program runs, it
should print p, @a[(mersenne p)], and the result of the prime test.
Use @a[mersenne-range] to find all values of p less than or equal to
257 for which 2@+[p]@t[-]1 is prime.

@b[Part 7:] Generalize @a[mersenne-range] to a procedure called
@a[prime-filter-check], which takes as input two integers @a[a] and
@a[b], a predicate called @a[filter], and a procedure of one argument
called @a[term].  For each integer @a[n] in the range from @a[a] to
@a[b] for which @a[(filter n)] is true, the program should check (using
@a[fast-prime?]) whether @a[(term n)] is prime.  As a test, calling the
procedure with @a[filter] as @a[prime?] and @a[term] as @a[mersenne]
should do the same thing as the @a[mersenne-range] procedure of part
6.

@b[Part 8:]  It is a curious fact that numbers of the
form @a[n@+[2]+n+41] are all prime, at least for low values of @a[n].  Use
the procedure you wrote in part 7 to answer the following questions:
(a) What are the ten smallest positive integers @a[n] for which 
@a[n@+[2]+n+41] is not prime? (b) What are the ten smallest @i[primes] @a[p]
for which @a[p@+[2]+p+41] is not prime?

@section(Post-lab Write-up)

After you are through at the lab, you are to write up and
hand in answers to the following questions:

1. What is the smallest divisor of each of the numbers 
that you tested in part 1?

2. Prepare a neat copy of the table you made, listing the 3 primes in
each of the 4 ranges and the corresponding timings for each of the
three primality tests.

3. The number of steps in the first prime test should grow as fast as
the square root of the number being tested.  We should expect
therefore that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about
sqrt(10) times as long as testing for primes around 1000.  Does your
timing data <Time1> bear this out?  How well does the data for 100,000
and 1,000,000 support the sqrt(n) prediction?

4. The modification you made in part 3 was designed to speed up the
prime test by halving the number of test steps.  So you should expect
it to run about twice as fast.  Does your data bear this out?  For
each of the primes in your table, compute the ratio <Time1>/<Time2>.
Does this ratio appear to be constant (i.e., more or less independent
of the number being tested)?  Does the ratio indicate that the new
test runs twice as fast as the old?  If not, what is the actual ratio
and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?

5. The number of steps required by the @a[fast-prime?] test has O(log n)
growth.  How then would you expect the time to test primes near
100,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000?  How
well does your data bear this out?  Can you explain any discrepancy
you find?

6. Which of the numbers in Mersenne's list do in fact yield primes?
What numbers did Mersenne miss?

7. In Part 5, how long did your program take to test primality of
2@+[127]@t[-]1?  Estimate how long the first prime testing algorithm (Part
1) would require to check the primality of this number?  To answer
this question, extrapolate from the data you collected in the <Time1>
entries of your table, together with the fact that the number of steps
required grows as sqrt(n).  Give the answer, not in seconds, but
in whatever unit seems to most appropriately express the amount of
time required (e.g., minutes, hours, days, ...).  Be sure to explain
how you arrived at your estimate.

8.  Turn in listings of the @a[mersenne-range] and
@a[prime-filter-check] procedures that you wrote in parts 6 and 7.

9.  What are the answers you obtained in part 8?  How did you use the
procedure in part 7 to find these answers?

10.  Do Exercise 1.20.

11.  Do Exercise 1.21.
