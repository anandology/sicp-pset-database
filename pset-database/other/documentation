I. Introduction

This subdirectory of the Scheme problem set database contains Scheme
problem sets that were not developed for MIT's 6.001 course.

As of now, there is only one entry in this subdirectory, but we hope
that others will make contributions.  Please submit your problem 
sets with a brief description of their content and the material 
they cover to the Scheme problem set librarian:
