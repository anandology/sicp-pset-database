There are two separate problem sets in this directory.

1.  ADVENTURE.TEXT, ADVENTURE.SCM, and ADV-WORLD.SCM are the
"traditional" adventure problem set. Here, message-passing means
calling an object (represented as a procedure) with a message
(represented as a symbol).

2. OBJ-ADVENTURE.TXT, OBJ-ADVENTURE.SCM, and OBJ-ADVENTURE.MOD
form a version which supports ASK, SELF, and a limited kind
of inheritance.
