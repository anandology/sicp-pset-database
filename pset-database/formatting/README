FORMATTING DETAILS

Files in the 6.001 problem set repository are formatted in various
formats: plain text, TeX, and scribe. Many of the TeX files use the
macros defined in the file 6001mac.tex found in this directory.  Some
of the TeX files are formatted in yTeX (pronounced "oops tech"), an
MIT specific formatting package developed by Dan Brotsky when he was
at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab.  This directory contains files
that allow you to build your own version of yTeX.  Below are the
instructions for this process.


BUILDING YTEX

[Disclaimer: I am not a TeX wizard. But I was able to build yTeX
on my Unix box (an HP 715/50) using the following steps. Your experience
may vary!]

1. The yTeX installation process uses 'initex' and 'virtex', two executables
that are part of a TeX environment. Find out where these live in 
your environment.

2. With this formatting directory in your path, execute the command

   initex ytex-cm.tex '\dump'

This will leave a file ytex-cm.fmt in your current directory.

3. Add the ytex-cm.fmt file to the set of known TeX formats. There
are two ways to do this:

  i. Copy ytex-cm.fmt to the TeX format directory on your machine. (On my 
     machine, it happens to be called "/usr/contrib/tex/libdir/formats/".)

  ii. Set the environment variable TEXFORMATS to include the directory
      in which ytex-cm.fmt resides, in addition to format directory
      mentioned in (i).

4. You can now format a yTeX file foo.tex by invoking the command

   virtex \&ytex foo.tex

You can bundle this up into an executable shell file as follows:

   #!/bin/csh
   exec /usr/contrib/tex/bin/virtex \&ytex $* 

(Don't forget a newline after the '*' !)


BUILDING YTEX USING OZTEX ON A MAC
[Thanks to Edward Hoenkamp for this info]

1.  Create a folder 'ytex' in 'TeX-inputs', and save the ytex files there.

2.  Edit the plain files in the ytex folder (see step 1.) to NOT load the 
TFM files.  You can do this by commenting out the lines 
"\font\preloaded=manfnt % METAFONT..." This is line 463 in plain.tex, and 
140 in plain-cm.tex

3. Edit the 'Default' file in 'Configs': At the end of the line that starts 
with ' format files' add 'ytex-cm', and at the end that starts 
with 'TeX input folder(s) ', add ' :TeX-inputs:ytex: '.

4. Start OzTeX. Select 'Tex...' in the TeX menu. This brings up a dialogue. 
Select the folder 'ytex', and CANCEL. This makes 'ytex' the default folder.

5. Run INITEX. After the '**' write 'ytex-cm\dump'

6. After a while a dialogue appears that has the filename 'ytex-cm.fmt' 
higlighted. Before you save this file select the folder 'TeX-formats', 
then save.

>From now on, whenever you start OzTeX, it has 'ytex-cm' added to the 'TeX' 
menu. Select this to format ytex files.
